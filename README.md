Just a mixture of SFML, EnTT, and Box2d.

### Frequent Compile Error Cause
 - Haven't included needed-to-be-compiled in script/makefile
 - Haven't included needed header in script/makefile

### How to compile
```make -f script/makefile [-j(how many jobs at once)]```
increasing -j parameter decrease compile time
